# Website development coursework for Software Engineering Beng 2015/16
This is a piece of coursework I did for Web Application Development module during 2nd year of University. To cut the story short, my timescale of implementing a website was less than two months and I took a rushed decision to develop my own content management system, because I was worried that popular frameworks like Wordpress would work against me and I had a clear vision of how the system might look like after discovering the true purpose of the PHP language. Thus, my website user interface looks very outdated, but it is very functional and robust.

# What the website is about?
The website allows people to register an account and create events (i.e. conferences and workshops) as well as view them and speakers. If users are interested, they can book some of them.

# NOTE: The link for website hosting is not working anymore.
Unfortunately, my hosting provider changed their configurations in handling HTTP protcols and now my website is not working anymore. My future task is to write a Vagrantfile that will allow people to clone the repo and run a localised version of my website.
